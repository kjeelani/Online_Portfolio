			<h3>Endless Woodlands</h3>
			<p>This is a game that I use countlessly to entice my students into learning Python. It is a text-based adventure game where you are lost in an endless forest with no clue how you arrived. There are monsters to fight,puzzles to solve, and different boss encounters depending on your choices. It is a game that teaches conditional chaining, functional programming, and class implementation, and is perfect for a final project in Python.</p>

			<h3>Statistical Calculator</h3>
			<p>This wa an applet I designed to help with statistical analysis before I obtained a graphing calculator. There are defintely many more functions I can add, such as ncdf(), tcdf(), and countless significance test functions, but I decided to be simple and just print out basic data. I do have one that also prints out 1var and 2var graphs, but it will not run on repl.it, so this is a basic version of the full applet.</p>

			<h3>Snake Game</h3>
			<p>A very basic two-player snake game that I plan on implementing into my curriculum in order to teach the turtle library. There are no textures, just shapes, but the functionality of the game works pretty well. There are two different types of "foods" that the snake can eat to gain length and speed. In the future, I might go back and create an algorithm that factors in the amount of food eaten and not just who dies first, but for now, not eating food seems to be the best way to win. <strong>RUN IN PYGAME OR ON AN IDE.</strong></p>

			<h3>Space Madness</h3>
			<p>An offshoot of the genre of text-based adventure games, this one was made very recently as my other one(Endless Woodlands) had absolutely no comments(I know atrocius), and could get a bit complicated at times. This one was created by me and a friend in our computer science class, but with my friend's permission, I put a lot of effort into creating unique minigames and events that use a combination of lists, recursive loops, functions, and libraries filled with comments in order to use it in my nonprofit's curriculum. This one is more riddle-based, with less monsters to fight.</p>

			<h3>Elemental Bosses</h3>
			<p>This is probably the game that I put the most effort into. It has three different bosses at three different diffuclties, each with their own soundtrack, quirks, and easter eggs. While the HTML page is a bit too colorful, and the lore is lacking, the gameplay definitely makes up for it. It was created using a canvas in Javascript, and won me a competition at a mini-Hackathon.</p>

			<h3>Demon vs. Hero</h3>
			<p>It's in the name! This is a two player Javascript canvas game that has many interesting features. The first is that the hero is smaller/faster than the hero and can shoot swords. The hero can also be healed with Toxic Waste(I was 13 when I made this, don't judge). The demon, on the other hand, is slow and big, and takes a lot of damage from th Toxic Waste, but deals HUGE damage to the hero if the hero comes in contact with him. Make sure to have a friend to play with and have fun!</p>

			<h3>Wynncraft Merch</h3>
			<p>This was an HTML test at the place I work at, and I decided to have a go at it. While the design is blockish, it fits the theme of a medival RPG Minecraft server well,and the colors provide a nice "woodland" theme. It uses Javascript to create a slideshow of images from the original Wynncraft site, and it promotes their in-game merchandise in a consise manner.</p>

			<h3>BUY MY MUSIC</h3>
			<p>A testament to my old, cringy days of being a middle schooler, I dedicated a website specifically to "selling" my music. In reality, I just wanted exposure, but it was just for fun. It showcases the use of navbars, multi-page websites, and borders, and the music itself isn't half-bad.</p>
